## 🎮 How to Play

### 1️⃣ Setup

Pick a category such as:

### 3️⃣ Secret Roles

Each player taps their card privately to reveal their role:

* Most players see the **same secret word**
* One player becomes the **IMPOSTER** and sees `"IMPOSTER"` instead

Keep your role secret 👀.

Players describe the word carefully — not too obvious, not too vague.

The Imposter must:

* Blend in
* Analyze clues
* Try to figure out the hidden word

### 5️⃣ Vote

After discussion, everyone votes for who they think the Imposter is!
